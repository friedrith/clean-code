The clean code method is a opinionated way to clean your code following the book _Clean Code_ by Robert C. Martin ([Apple Book](https://books.apple.com/ca/audiobook/clean-code-a-handbook-of-agile-software/id1556265951), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Code-Robert-Martin-Craftsmanship/dp/B08LF126HT/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)).

This repo is just a list of examples illustrated with code and is not intended to be exhaustive.
