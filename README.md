# Clean code

The clean code method is a opinionated way to clean your code following the book _Clean Code_ by Robert C. Martin ([Apple Book](https://books.apple.com/ca/audiobook/clean-code-a-handbook-of-agile-software/id1556265951), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Code-Robert-Martin-Craftsmanship/dp/B08LF126HT/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)).

This repo is just a list of examples illustrated with code and is not intended to be exhaustive.

> Never consider the following rules are absolute. They are best practices to follow but the job of developers is to understand the context and constraints and estimate when it is useful to apply these rules and when it is better to break them.

## Rules

- [Prefer polymorphism to if/else and switch/case](./rules/prefer-polymorphism-to-if-else.md)
- [Boy scout rule](./rules/boy-scout-rule.md)
- [Less comments is better](./rules/less-comments-is-better.md)
